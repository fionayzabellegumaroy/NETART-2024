            Roblox Studios is a gaming platform with a variety of user-created multiplayer games.
            Not only am I interested in the platform due to its game development capabilities, but because of the nostalgia associated with it as I used to be a kid playing in Roblox and meeting random people. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            explanation
        </h3>
        <p>
            For my web intervention, I planned to join a variety of popular games and ask a "philosophical" question to the public. I joined a total of five Roblox games (and one league of legends game): one that is more action packed, a role playing game, and a more chill game. This intervention took place on the afternoon of March 9, 2024.

            effects of intervention

        <p>
            I expected to garner more attention, especially in games that involved a lot of talking (for example, the role playing game that I joined); however, I only got two responses. I originally planned on just asking what people thought would happen after they died, but no one responded; so I decided to go for a lighter question: "If you wanted to change something about yourself, what would it be?". It might have been the way I approached the conversation, but I did not know how else to. Because of the lack of reponses, I decided to open League of Legends and join a quick game to ask everyone in the lobby the question "What do you think happens after we die?". However, no one responded in the 30 minutes that we played.

            if i had more time...

            I would have done more games as well as approached the situation more patiently and differently. I might have spent at least 30 minutes a game to create the mood and background so that more people are willing to answer such a random, obsure question, especially when they might be gaming to distract themselves from reality.
