        <div class="description">
            In “Empowering Women: A Celebration of Women in Art”, the exhibition explores the importance of bodily autonomy, body integrity, and the idea of a person’s uncoerced choice. This idea is illuminated through the variety of artworks that is showcased: from the lens of cyberfeminism to destigmatizing sex work to a dating simulator that replicates interactions with men that view women as conquests, and finally, the use of AI to manipulate a female character’s physical appearance. While it is not limited to the experiences that women solely go through, the exhibition prioritizes talking and highlighting the works of female presenting people and/or the works focusing female presenting people.

                        This art project displays an empowering Cyberfeminist Manifesto. It was first exhibited on a 6 by 3 billboard, where the manifesto sits on the shoulders and neck of a bald female presenting person, who resembles the body language of the sculpture “The Thinker”.
